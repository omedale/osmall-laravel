                <h3>Account Protection</h3>
                <p>Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers and letters and do not disclose your
                    password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember
                    that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of
                    your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to
                    legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for
                    any reason, you should immediately notify us and change your password.</p>
                <p>We will never ask for your password by phone or e-mail, so if you receive such an inquiry, please

                <p>If you access our Website from a shared computer or a computer in an internet cafe, a PC room or a
                    library, certain information about you, such as your user ID, activity or reminders from the
                    Website, may also be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you. To protect your
                    personal information or communication from being disclosed to others, you should log out and close
                    the web browser after using our Website</p>
                <h3>Accessing, Reviewing, Changing and Retaining Your Personal Information</h3>
                <p>You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to the Website.
                    Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to
                    verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or
                    becomes inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon
                    your request to the customer service, we will close your account and remove your personal
                    information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in
                    accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply
                    with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with
                    any investigations, enforce our User Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
                    Otherwise, your personal information will be destroyed by us once we confirm there is no use for
                    it.</p>
                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>Your information is stored on our servers located in the Malaysia. We treat data as an asset that
                    must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect
                    your personal information against unauthorised access and disclosure. However, as you probably know,
                    third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other
                    users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore,
                    although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect,
                    that your personal information or private communications will always remain private</p>
                <h3>Third Parties</h3>
                <p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Policy, this document addresses only the use and
                    disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether
                    they are buyers or sellers on our Website or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules
                    may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. We do not control the
                    privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third
                    parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions and to review their privacy policies
                    before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>
                <h3>Consent</h3>
                <p>By continuing to use Website, you consent to the processing of your personal data in accordance with
                    the Privacy Policy Policy, Terms &amp; Conditions and Seller Agreement by Company.</p>
                <h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>Intermedius Open Supermall Sdn Bhd reserves the right to modify and change the Privacy Policy Policy
